# LncReader

We aim to explore whether LncReader provides a sophisticated and practical tool to identify dual functional lncRNAs and explore potentially lncRNA-encoded micropeptides, which might assist dissection the key roles of dual functional lncRNAs in either physiology or pathology conditions.
