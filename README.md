# LncReader

We aim to explore whether LncReader provides a sophisticated and practical tool to identify dual functional lncRNAs and explore potentially lncRNA-encoded micropeptides, which might assist dissection the key roles of dual functional lncRNAs in either physiology or pathology conditions.

The research of LncReader is online. Please cite us with <a href="https://academic.oup.com/bib/article/24/1/bbac579/6961607" target="_blank">LncReader: identification of dual functional long noncoding RNAs using a multi-head self-attention mechanism</a>
